##### *Why is Markdown better than a word processor?* 
Markdown is versatile and will look great everywhere. Have you ever tried to copy paste your Microsoft Word resume into a textbox, or other text editor? Word processors do not translate very well to anything but their own suite. This makes distributing your resume a nightmare when potential employers request different document types. However, Markdown keeps your formatting in-line, allowing it to be easily translated to other formats.

##### *Why is my resume not showing up?*
There are many reasons that could cause your website to not show up, all stemming from not following the above instructions precisely. During my first attempt, I had forgotten to name the markdown resume in my repository "**index.md"**. Another common issue could be that your repository is named incorrectly (it must exaxctly match your github account name).
